## Overview

The future of shopping is here: customers can now shop using AI agents instead of traditional websites and apps. The Agentic Loyalty Protocol (ALP) is Benji's revolutionary new standard that makes your loyalty programs available in these agentic shopping experiences. When customers shop through AI agents powered by Stripe and OpenAI, Benji's ALP ensures your loyalty programs are right there in the cart, providing real-time loyalty enrichment and rewards.

## What is Agentic Shopping?

Imagine your customers asking an LLM chat tool which product they should buy. Then, instead of them having to do anything else, the AI chat experience serves up your product and completes the sale, all without your website or shop being involved at all. The agent handles everything: finding products, comparing prices, and completing the purchase. This is **agentic shopping** - the revolutionary new way customers are starting to shop using AI agents like ChatGPT.

## How ALP Makes Benji Available in Agentic Shopping

ALP is Benji's breakthrough technology that puts your loyalty programs directly into these AI shopping experiences. When customers shop through AI agents, Benji's ALP ensures your loyalty rewards, points, and benefits are automatically applied and visible to the customer - no separate app or website needed.

<Info>
  ALP is fully compliant with the Agentic Commerce Protocol (ACP) standards built by Stripe and OpenAI, and requires no partner approval to implement.
