All API endpoints are authenticated using API keys via the `x-api-key` header. There are 2 types of API keys supported:
- **User based access tokens**, to initiate user based activities such as earn, redeem and get status actions. These tokens are returned as part of the access/token/exchange API flow following the connect SDK onSuccess callback.
- **Partner API keys**, which you can generate through the dashboard in your developer settings page on Pilot, for all non user based interactions like retrieving campaign and partner information.

<Warning>
  Note that user tokens are short lived and must be refreshed using the access/token/refresh API endpoint before they expire. User tokens are typically valid for 90 days. If a token has expired, you will get a 401 error from the relevant API endpoint. You can refresh the token using the access/token/refresh API endpoint.
</Warning>

<Tip>In APIs that support user_id or user_external_ids, you can either use the Partner API key and explicitly specify the user_id, or use the user based access token and omit these parameters since they are distinguished through the access token</Tip>
