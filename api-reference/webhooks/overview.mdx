## Overview

The Benji Platform webhooks allow you to receive updates in near real time on activities in your partnership ecosystem. The following webhook entities are supported:
-**Users** : Updates on a user's partner connect status and lifecycle on the Benji Platform.
-**Campaigns** : Updates to relevant campaigns and their lifecycle on the Benji Platform
-**Transactions** : Updates on reward transaction statuses and lifecycle.

### Webhook Format

All webhooks contain the following JSON body parameters : 
<ParamField body="event" type="string" required>The name of the event</ParamField>
<ParamField body="entity_type" type="integer">
    Integer representing an enum of one of the following entity type values : 
        <Expandable title="possible entity type values" type="enum">
            - **USER (1)** : Indicating a user entity <br/>
            - **CAMPAIGN (2)** : Indicating a campaign entity  <br/>
            - **TRANSACTION (3)** : Indicating a reward transaction entity
        </Expandable>
</ParamField>
<ParamField body="entity_id" type="integer">The ID of the entity</ParamField>

### Webhook Authentication

In order to optionally authenticate and validate that the webhook was received from the Benji Platform, Benji provides a header value representing a signature that you can then validate.
The signature is essentially the webhook body, signed with the salt provided in the response from the [subscribe endpoint](/api-reference/webhooks/subscribe), using a HMAC SHA-256 (HS256) algorithm.
To authenticate the webhook, you can go through the following steps : 
- Store the salt returned in the subscribe API call.
- When receiving a webhook:
  - Extract the timestamp from the x-benji-timestamp header value
  - Create the signature input by concatenating: **timestamp** and **body**
  - Generate a signature using HMAC SHA-256 with your stored salt: HMAC-SHA256(salt, concatenated timestamp and body string)
- Extract the provided signature from the x-benji-signature header value
- Compare your signed body and the signature provided, and continue processing the webhook only if the signatures match.

The webhook will also contain a header including the datetime in GMT format of the event. Typically, you can use this field to validate that this webhook is not a **replay** event.

<ParamField header="x-benji-signature" type="string">Signature described above</ParamField>
<ParamField header="x-benji-timestamp" type="string">String representing the datetime in GMT format of the event</ParamField>

### Webhook body sample

```json 
{
    "event": "reward_transaction_updated",
    "entity": 3,
    "entity_id": 243
}
```
### Webhook Flow
A typical webhook flow requires the following steps :
- **[Subscribe to an event](/api-reference/webhooks/subscribe)** and register your webhook endpoint. The Benji Platform will send any updates to this event to this endpoint using a **POST** request.
- **Listen to any webhooks** on your registered webhook event endpoint
- **Call the Benji Platform API** to retrieve additional information on the entity based on the event and the entity_type parameters in the webhook.

### Supported events
The following events and their corresponding entity types are supported :
#### User Events
<Expandable title="User Events">
    - user_partner_connected : Indicating a user has succefully connected with a partner through the Benji Platform
</Expandable>
<Tip>Typically after receiving a user entity webhook event, you will interact with the [get user status](/api-reference/endpoint/status/get) endpoint using the entity_id from the webhook to receive additional user data</Tip>
#### Campaign Events
<Expandable title="Campaign Events">
    - campaign_updated : Indicating a campaign that you are associated with has been updated
    - campaign_activated : Indicating a campaign you are associated with has been activated (either manually or by reaching its scheduled date)
    - campaign_ended : Indicating a campaign has ended (either manually or by surpassing it's end date)
</Expandable>
<Tip>Typically after receiving a campaign entity webhook event, you will interact with the [get campaign](/api-reference/endpoint/campaigns/get) endpoint using the entity_id from the webhook to receive additional campaign data</Tip>
#### Transaction Events
<Expandable title="Transaction Events">
    - transaction_authenticated : Indicating a [transaction authentication token](/api-reference/endpoint/transactions/authenticate) has been created
    - transaction_created : Indicating a [transaction has been created](/api-reference/endpoint/transactions/create)
    - transaction_status_updated : Indicating a transaction has been updated, typically meaning a status change on the transaction
</Expandable>
<Tip>Typically after receiving a transaction entity webhook event, you will interact with the [get reward transaction](/api-reference/endpoint/transactions/get) endpoint using the entity_id from the webhook to receive additional transaction data</Tip>
