## What is Benji Connect?

Benji Connect enables you to connect your members to reward loyalty partners, allowing them to earn and redeem rewards through your platform. There are two ways to integrate Benji Connect into your application:

- **Benji Hosted Connect** - A fully hosted landing page solution
- **Benji Connect SDK** - A JavaScript SDK for embedded integration

Both approaches accomplish the same goal—connecting your members to reward partners—but differ in implementation, customization, and user experience.

## Hosted Connect

Benji Hosted Connect is a fully hosted solution where you redirect users to a Benji-managed page that handles the entire connection flow. No frontend code changes are required.

**Best suited for:**

- Quick integrations without frontend development
- Server-side implementations or email campaigns
- Multi-platform support using a single hosted URL
- Dedicated partner landing pages

## Connect SDK

The Benji Connect SDK is a JavaScript SDK that you embed directly into your application. It provides an inline modal experience and gives you full control over when and how the connection flow is triggered.

**Best suited for:**

- Native app integrations
- Web applications requiring seamless user experience
- Scenarios where you want the connection flow embedded in your UI
- Advanced customization and event handling
