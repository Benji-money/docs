# Integration Configuration

Benji Integrations are designed to work out of the box with no configuration required.

## Default Behavior
- Once connected, Benji automatically syncs the necessary data.
- All rules configured in Pilot are respected and enforced.

## Optional Settings
Currently, there are no additional configuration options. Future updates may allow for more customization.

> **Stay Updated:** Check the [Benji Changelog](../README.md) or [Release Notes](../README.md) for new configuration options as they become available.

## Managing Integrations
- Disconnect or reconnect your integration at any time from Developer Settings.
