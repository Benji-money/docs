# Events

Benji processes several types of events from your payment processor to power loyalty and rewards.

## Event Types
- **Purchase**: Triggered when a customer makes a purchase.
- **Refund**: Triggered when a purchase is refunded.
- **Order Update**: Triggered when order contents change.

> **Note:** These event types apply to all supported integrations (e.g., Square, Stripe). See [Integration Overview](./overview.mdx) for platform-specific details.

## Event Payload Examples
```json
{
  "type": "purchase",
  "customer_id": "12345",
  "amount": 100.00,
  "items": [
    { "sku": "A1", "qty": 2 }
  ]
}
```

## How Events Affect Loyalty
Events are used to determine eligibility, accrue or redeem points, and handle reversals automatically.
