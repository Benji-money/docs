# Webhooks

Benji uses webhooks to listen for important events from your payment processor, such as purchases and refunds.

## What are Webhooks?
Webhooks are automated messages sent from apps when something happens. Benji uses them to stay up-to-date with your customersâ€™ activity.

## Events We Listen To
- Purchases
- Refunds
- Order updates

## How Benji Uses Events
When an event occurs, Benji:
- Checks eligibility for loyalty accrual or redemption
- Updates customer loyalty status
- Handles reversals in case of refunds

## No Setup Required
Benji manages all webhook subscriptions for you. No action is needed on your end.
