title: API Usage
---

Benji uses information about loyalty customers, their status, and their payment transactions in order to power the automatic processing and eligibility determination for each transaction.

## API Access
Not all data is present in webhooks provided by our integrators, so we correlate that information with loyalty customers using their APIs.

Benji uses the following APIs:

- **Payments**: Correlate payments with orders and customers.
- **Loyalty Customers**: Ensure we can connect the customer to their loyalty accounts for our suite of partners.
- **Orders**: Analyze the orders placed by customers to determine eligibility for rewards.

> **Note:** This data applies to all supported integrations (e.g., Square, Stripe). See [Integration Overview](./overview) for platform-specific details.

## Event Payload Examples
```json
{
  "type": "purchase",
  "customer_id": "12345",
  "amount": 100.00,
  "items": [
    { "sku": "A1", "qty": 2 }
  ]
}
```
