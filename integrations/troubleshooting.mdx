Having trouble with your integration? Here are some common issues and solutions.

## Connection Issues
- Ensure your Square account credentials are correct.
- If an admin has disconnected your Square account, you can find this in your Square console at: Settings->App integrations. Benji should be listed. If it is not, then we have been disconnected and you'll need to reauthorize through the Benji UI.

## Data Sync Issues
- Data may take a few minutes to sync after connecting.
- While Square sends events almost real time, we process those payments in the background. Loyalty accruals may not be immediate.
