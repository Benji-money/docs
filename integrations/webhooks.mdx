Benji listens to webhooks from your payment processor, giving access to events such as purchases and refunds.

## What are Webhooks?
Webhooks are automated messages sent from services or applications when something happens. Benji uses them to stay up-to-date with your customersâ€™ activity.

## Events We Listen To
- Payments
- Refunds
- Orders

## How Benji Uses these Events
When an event occurs, Benji:
- Checks eligibility for loyalty accrual or redemption
- Updates customer loyalty status in our integrated Loyalty Partners' systems
- Handles reversals in case of refunds

## No Setup Required
Benji manages all webhook subscriptions for you. No action is needed on your end. 

> **Note:** Webhook endpoints are managed automatically by Benji and are not user-configurable in the UI.
