## Campaign Type

In this section you can configure the distinct campaign type for this campaign. <img src="/images/pilot/campaign_type.png" alt="title" />

The Benji Platform supports 3 types of different campaign types :

- **Earn Points** : A campaign that once triggered, and if the specific conditions are met, will distribute points to the connected user based on the base points distribution amount and any multipliers associated with the specific connected user.
- **Pay with Points** : A campaign that once triggered, and if the specific conditions are met, will allow the users to redeem points to use to purchase items (or partial items) on the partner's online store.
- **Connect Only** : A status sharing only campaign , meant to connect member data between your and your partners accounts. In this campaign type there is no movement of points to or from members.

## Campaign Trigger

In this section you can configure the the action the trigger to activate the campaign. This action essentially triggers a rule engine, that validates the conditions associated with the campaign, and attaches any configured multipliers to the transaction if the connected member is eligible for a multiplier. <img src="/images/pilot/campaign_trigger.png" alt="title" />

The Benji Platform currently supports the following trigger types :

- **Spend Per Dollar** : Triggered on a transaction event on the partner's store.
- **Registration** : Triggered when a member registers on the partner store and connects their account through the Benji platform to your loyalty program.
- **Customer Referral** : Triggered when a connected member makes a succesful referal on the partner store.
- **Custom Action** : A custom action that can be triggered from anywhere on the partner's store. This is meant for use cases that are not yet natively supported by the platform and provides flexibility to create any type of campaign using Benji's APIs.

<Tip>
  Triggers are especially useful when used in conjuction with Benji Drop In components. The drop in components can automatically render on the partner's online store based on these triggers and their respective placement
</Tip>

- **Points per dollar spent** : This numeric value represents the base value of a transaction with your points. For Earn type campaigns, this represents the base value of how many reward points the connected member will be earning for every dollar spent. For Pay with Points type campaigns, this value represents the base amount of dollars each reward point is worth on the partner's store. This value will not be displayed for Connect Only type campaigns.

## Campaign Actions

In this section you can configure the base actions that will occur when a trigger happens and the relevant conditions are met

![title](/Screenshot2026-02-04at11.08.31AM.png)

You can configure multiple actions per campaign.

<Tip>
  A common example for a campaign with multiple actions is receiving rewards from both partners. For instance - Earn 2 reward points from Partner A and 3 reward points form partner B for every transaction
</Tip>

For each action, you can specify the action itself, which partner controls the action (if applicable), and the **base** conversion rate of the action :

<Tip>
  When configuring an action, you will only be able to set your own organization as the owner of the action. If there is another partner they will be able to do the same. The actions owned by the other partner will be visible in read only mode on your account.
</Tip>

**Action**

<Expandable title="Action">
  Possible values of actions to perform:

  - **Award Points/Redeem Points** : Dependent on if the canpaign is an Earn or Redeem type campaign
  - **Award Cashback** : If applicable and configured in your settings, enables earning cashback for a trigger on the user's account.
</Expandable>

**Partner**

The partner owning this action. This will be automatically filled in based on who is editing/creating the campaign.

**Conversion Rate**

<Expandable title="Conversion Rate">
  The base value of conversion of the action :

  - **Reward Distribution Value** : A number representing the value of the conversion (e.g. **3 reward point per dollar spent**)
</Expandable>

<Tip>
  The conversion rate configured in this section is the **base** conversion rate. Any configured multipliers will take affect based on the conversion rates defined in this section.
</Tip>

## Campaign Conditions

In this section you can configure the the conditions associated with a valid campaign trigger. When a trigger is met, the Benji Platform will validate the conditions configured on the campaign, and will approve and initiate the campaign transaction only if the conditions are met. <img src="/images/pilot/campaign_conditions.png" alt="title" />

You can configure a limitless amount of conditions per campaign, and configure whether the association between each condition is an OR , meaning just one of the conditions need to be met, or as an AND, meaning all of the conditions need to met to satisfy the condition. For each condition, you can specify the attribute the condition is applied to, an operator, and a value that meets the conditions. The following attributes and their respective operators and values are supported:

**Customer Geography**

<Expandable title="Customer Geography">
  Will only be valid if the user meets the geographical condition.

  - **Operators** : **Is In** or **Is Not In**
  - **Values** : Countries, US cities
</Expandable>

**Customer Total Spend**

<Expandable title="Customer Spend">
  Will only be valid if the user has exceeded a total spend amount since they connected their account. For instance, if the campaign distributes a certain amount of reward points after the member has purchased over \$1000 in goods.

  - **Operators** : **Greater Than**
  - **Values** : Numeric amount
</Expandable>

**Transaction Basket Size**

<Expandable title="Basket Size">

</Expandable>

## Campaign Multipliers

In this section you can configure certain conditions under which a certain member would get a multiplier boost on their earned or redeemed rewards for a specific transaction.

For **Earn** type campaigns, this means the member, if the condition is met, will earn a multiplier on the base Points earned per dollar variable configured in the triggers section.

For **Redeem** type campaigns, this means the member will get a multiplier on the conversion rate per dollar defined in the triggers section above. 

![Screenshot 2026 02 04 At 11 39 50 AM](/images/Screenshot2026-02-04at11.39.50AM.png)

You can configure a limitless amount of multipliers per campaign. For each multiplier, you can specify the multiplier amount, a customer attribute to validate (the condition) and the corresponding value of the customer attribute to validate. The following customer attributes are supported :

**Customer Status**

<Expandable title="Customer Status">
  Will only be valid if the user is of a certain status.

  - **Operators** : **Is In** or **Is Not In**

</Expandable>

**Variable Attributes**

<Expandable title="Customer Spend">
  You can create multipliers based on any attribute returned as part of the Benji Platform integration with your platform. A typical example example would be Card Member status, # of total rewards earned throughout their membership etc.

  - **Operators** : **Is In** or **Is Not In**
  - **Values** : Configrable values based on the variable attribute possible values configured in the settings section of the Benji Platform.
</Expandable>

## Campaign Limits

In this section you can configure limits to control how frequently members can qualify for rewards and the maximum value they can earn or redeem.

![Screenshot 2026 02 04 At 11 12 05 AM](/images/Screenshot2026-02-04at11.12.05AM.png)

Limits set boundaries on transaction values, member qualification frequency, and total rewards. You can set transaction minimums to ensure meaningful engagement, cap total rewards per user, or limit qualification frequency to control the pacing of your campaigns.

You can configure multiple limits per campaign. The following limit types are supported:

**Transaction Limits**

<Expandable title="Transaction Limits">
  Controls the minimum or maximum value allowed per individual transaction.

  - **Operators**: Minimum, Maximum

## Campaign Goals

In this section you can configure goals for the campaign. Benji will track the progress of the campaign and display how you are tracking towards the goals in the partnerships analytics page when you filter by campaign, as well as send out email notifications on how you are tracking towards these goals on a weekly basis, as well as ad hoc emails when you are about to hit the campaign goals.
