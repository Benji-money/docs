The Developer Settings page provides tools for integrating with the Benji Platform programmatically. You can generate API keys for authentication, configure webhook endpoints to receive real-time updates, and connect to pre-built integrations.

### API Tokens

Generate and manage API keys to authenticate your requests to the Benji Platform API.

**Add Key**

Click the Add Key button to generate a new API key. You'll be prompted to enter a name for the key to identify it. When created, the full key value will be displayed once. Copy and store it securely, as you won't be able to view the complete key again. To access the key value later, you'll need to generate a new key.

**API Keys Table**

Each API key displays:

- **Key Name**: The identifier for the key
- **Key Value**: The API key value (masked for security)
- **Actions**:
  - **Edit**: Modify the key name
  - **Delete**: Remove the API key (this will invalidate it immediately)

**Important**: Store your API keys securely when first generated. They provide access to your Benji Platform account and should never be shared publicly or committed to version control. If you delete a key, update any applications using it immediately to prevent authentication failures. After creating keys, they can be used with the[ Benji API](/api-reference/authentication)

### Webhooks

Configure webhook endpoints to receive real-time notifications about users, campaigns, and transactions. Learn more about webhook implementation in the [Webhooks documentation](https://docs.withbenji.com/api-reference/webhooks/overview).

**Add Webhook**

Click the Add Webhook button to create a new webhook subscription. You'll need to provide:

- **Endpoint URL**: The URL where Benji will send webhook notifications
- **Entity Type**: Select USER or TRANSACTION to specify which type of events to receive
- **Event Name**: Select the specific event you want to subscribe to (options vary based on entity type)
- **Active**: Toggle to enable or disable the webhook

**Webhooks Table**

Each webhook displays:

- **Endpoint URL**: The destination for webhook notifications
- **Entity Type**: The type of entity (User or Transaction)
- **Event Name**: The specific event being monitored
- **Status**: Whether the webhook is active or inactive
- **Salt**: The authentication salt used for webhook [signature verification](https://docs.withbenji.com/api-reference/webhooks/overview#webhook-authentication)
- **Actions**: Edit webhook configuration, delete the webhook, or send a test webhook

**Entity Types and Events**

- **USER**: user_partner_connected
- **TRANSACTION**: transaction_authenticated, transaction_created, transaction_status_updated

For detailed information about webhook authentication and payload formats, click the info icon next to the Add Webhook button.

### Integrations

Connect your Benji account to pre-built integrations with third-party platforms and services. Available integrations streamline common workflows and data synchronization tasks.
