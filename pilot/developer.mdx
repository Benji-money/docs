The Developer Settings page provides tools for integrating with the Benji Platform programmatically. You can generate API keys for authentication, configure webhook endpoints to receive real-time updates, and connect to pre-built integrations.

### API Tokens

Generate and manage API keys to authenticate your requests to the Benji Platform API.

**API Keys Table**

Each API key displays:

- **Key Name**: The identifier for the key ("Benji API Key", "Connect SDK Key")
- **Key Value**: The API key value (masked by default)
- **Actions**:
  - **Show/Hide**: Click the eye icon to reveal or hide the full key value
  - **Copy**: Click the copy icon to copy the key to your clipboard
  - **Rotate**: Click the rotate icon to regenerate the key (this will invalidate the previous key)

**Important**: Store your API keys securely. They provide access to your Benji Platform account and should never be shared publicly or committed to version control. If you rotate a key, update it immediately in any applications using it. After creating keys, they can be used with the[ Benji API](/api-reference/authentication)

### Webhooks

Configure webhook endpoints to receive real-time notifications about users, campaigns, and transactions. Learn more about webhook implementation in the [Webhooks documentation](https://docs.withbenji.com/api-reference/webhooks/overview).

**Add Webhook**

Click the Add Webhook button to create a new webhook subscription. You'll need to provide:

- **Endpoint URL**: The URL where Benji will send webhook notifications
- **Entity Type**: Select USER or TRANSACTION to specify which type of events to receive
- **Event Name**: Select the specific event you want to subscribe to (options vary based on entity type)
- **Active**: Toggle to enable or disable the webhook

**Webhooks Table**

Each webhook displays:

- **Endpoint URL**: The destination for webhook notifications
- **Entity Type**: The type of entity (User or Transaction)
- **Event Name**: The specific event being monitored
- **Status**: Whether the webhook is active or inactive
- **Salt**: The authentication salt used for webhook [signature verification](https://docs.withbenji.com/api-reference/webhooks/overview#webhook-authentication)
- **Actions**: Edit webhook configuration, delete the webhook, or send a test webhook

**Entity Types and Events**

- **USER**: user_partner_connected
- **TRANSACTION**: transaction_authenticated, transaction_created, transaction_status_updated

For detailed information about webhook authentication and payload formats, click the info icon next to the Add Webhook button.

### Integrations

Connect your Benji account to pre-built integrations with third-party platforms and services. Available integrations streamline common workflows and data synchronization tasks.
